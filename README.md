Monitor and control you Centsys D5-Evo gate controller

# Status

Work in progress

# Goals
- [ ] Open gate remotely
- Hold gate open at:
  - [ ] Current Position
  - [ ] Man gate
  - [ ] Full open
  - [ ] Lock Closed
- [ ] Emergency mode
- [ ] Doorbell mode
- [ ] Install a light that comes on with gate operation

# Equipment
## List
- Centsys D5-evo
- Microcontroller
- Wifi comms
- Relays

## Existing Installation

Sliding gate with beam sensor on inside of gate. No other sensors present. Has GPRS modem installed which no longer works as there is no 2G in this area. Might be possible to use some of the existing 2G interface wiring as there is an antenna installed.

## Interfacing

### Serial
There is a serial port underneath the circuit board however no investigation has been done with this yet. After standard wiring has been used for this automation, the serial port may be investigated further.

### Gate Status using LED

The gate status is indicated by an LED. This LED is also wired to output as the table above. Wiring this to a micro controller can decode the flashes into the sates shown in the table below:

| LED State                       |            Description             |
|:------------------------------- |:----------------------------------:|
| Off                             |           Gate is closed           |
| On                              |  Gate is partially or fully open  |
| Continuous slow flash           |          Gate is opening           |
| Continuous fast flash           |          Gate is closing           |
| One flash every two seconds     | Pillar light override is activated |
| Two flashes very two seconds    |          No mains present          |
| Three flashes every two seconds |       Battery voltage is low       |

### Controller IO
Inputs:   6
<br>Outputs:  4
<br>UART: 1

Consideration required for other input device such as keypad or fingerprint reader.

Communications to house required.
