# Equipment
## List
- Centsys D5-evo
- Microcontroller with wifi
- Communications back to house powerline or wifi
- 4 way relay board

## Existing Installation

Sliding gate with beam sensor on inside of gate. No other sensors present. Has GPRS modem installed which no longer works as there is no 2G in this area. Might be possible to use some of the existing 2G interface wiring as there is an antenna installed.

## Interfacing to gate controller

### Serial
There is a serial port underneath the circuit board however no investigation has been done with this yet. After standard wiring has been used for this automation, the serial port may be investigated further.
![UART](/pictures/existing_pcb_serial_port_crop.jpeg)
What wasn't figured out until after this was put back outside was the SPI interface on the left hand side of the photo. The middle pad looks like a comms line on a scope. Breaking into this would be useful as it has battery current and absolute gate position etc.

### Gate Status using LED

The gate status is indicated by an LED. This LED is also wired to output as the table above. Wiring this to a micro controller can decode the flashes into the sates shown in the table below:

| LED State                       |            Description             |
|:------------------------------- |:----------------------------------:|
| Off                             |           Gate is closed           |
| On                              |  Gate is partially or fully open  |
| Continuous slow flash           |          Gate is opening           |
| Continuous fast flash           |          Gate is closing           |
| One flash every two seconds     | Pillar light override is activated |
| Two flashes very two seconds    |          No mains present          |
| Three flashes every two seconds |       Battery voltage is low       |

### Microcontroller IO
Inputs:   6
<br>Outputs:  4
<br>UART: 2

Consideration required for other input device such as keypad or fingerprint reader.

Communications to house required. 1x UART for comms with house. 1x UART for future gate controller communication.

As I'm waiting for parts to arrive for powerline communication, I'll use a `NodeMCU` in lieu of the powerline connector. This way, when the powerline modules arrive, I can just swap it out and it'll give a good indication of how reliable the wifi works in the meantime.

For the main controller, I'll use using an Arduino Mega - because that's what I have lying around and it has two serial ports.

# Communications
The gate is approx 10 metres from the house and has mains power available. Being the main entrance to the house, wifi is not the preferred communication as it is not deemed reliable in the event of an emergency. Two main alternatives are considered:
- Ethernet over Power line
- Serial over power line

## Ethernet over Power (Powerline adapter)
Ethernet over power is easy to achieve however te hardware is fairly bulky.

## Serial over Power (PLM/PLC)

Some available boards in the market:
- STEVAL-IHP005V1 at $AUD150 (and need one master plus one per node)
- NXP USA Inc. OM13313,598 but now obsolete
- Jarvie board are available at $65 Australian per [modem](https://www.tindie.com/products/jarvie/smart-home-power-line-modem-demo-board/)
- OR cheap and nasty...just the way I like it [KQ130F](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/1005001498852968.html?spm=a2g0s.9042311.0.0.4f0e4c4d9PnOt5) at $AUD13 each including shipping

KQ130F was chosen as I also have garden lights I'd like to control

## wifi
Giving Wifi a crack whilst waiting for the powerline to arrive. See NodeMCU below.

# Microcontroller

## Arduino Mega
Connect as per table 4.

## Node MCU as Powerline Substitute
NodeMCU with ESP-12E chip selected. Used Software serial to begin with but will likely change to hardware serial later.


### Configuration
1. If using Software serial, start here. If using Hardware, start at step 6.
1. Download Tasmota source
1. Configure user settings if you so wish, or do via web interface later
1. If using Software Serial, Set `#define TM_SERIAL_BUFFER_SIZE        64` in `TasmotaSerial.h`
1. Compile
2. Flash NodeMCU with Tasmota
3. Configure wifi to your liking
3. Configure as `Generic (18)`
4. Configure pins RX and TX tp `Serial Rx` and `Serial Tx` (for hardware serial config - also works on different pins with software serial using config `SerBrTx` and `SerBrRx`)
5. Set baudrate - for software serial `SBaudrate 115200`
  Note: if an unknown error occurs, you haven't configred the pins to serial bridge properly
6. Configure MQTT broker
7. Set a web interface password if you so desire
8. Back up your config

### Commands over `MQTT`
TO active a relay, send an MQTT message to `cmnd/frontgate/serialsend` with the payload of the number corresponding to output programmed in the gate.ino file.

For example, to activate `Lock Open On` send `cmnd/frontgate/serialsend 3`. To deactivate `Lock Open On` send `cmnd/frontgate/serialsend 4`. This activates and deactivates relay 2.

Note: for software serial, use SSerialSend.
